# camel-smb-apps

I've written a few spring-boot apps that test the camel-smb component - storing them here.

For both camel-smb-consumer and camel-smb-producer, the apps require a src/main/resource/config.properties that
contains a camel.smb.username and camel.smb.password value.    config.properties is set in .gitignore and will not be checked in.
